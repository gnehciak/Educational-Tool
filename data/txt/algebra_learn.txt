An algebraic expression is one in which letters are used to represent numbers. We refer to these letters as variables.
An equation is a mathematical statement that two expressions are equal. The solution of the equation is the value of the unknown (variable) that makes these expressions equal in value.
For example, to solve the equation 4x + 7 = 19 + x means to find the value of the unknown x such that the value of the expression 4x + 7 is the same as the value of the expression 19 + x. In this case, x = 4 is the solution.
If x = 4, then 4x + 7 = 4 Ã— 4 + 7 = 23 and 19 + x = 19 + 4 = 23.
